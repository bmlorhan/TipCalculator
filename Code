Simple tip Calculator

Notes:

simple tip calculator
use -
user enters bill amount and receives a tip amount based on tip percentage

problems:
No option does not determine a new tip amount after re-rating the server. -  CONQUERED!
'''


''' Function payment
#The main function
#Check to see if the tip has been calculated using var tipcalculated
#asks for the bill amount
#asks for a rating, later used to determine the tippercent
#runs the tip function using the entered rating
#the function returns a tippercent
#as long as tipcalculated is False
#Asks for confirmation that the tip is okay.
#If yes, runs the calculator function using the entered values and produces the tip + total bill
#Returns tipcalculated as True, ending the application.
#If no, user will be asked to re-rate their server
#This will continue until the user is satisfied with the tip and accepts, enters Yes
