README for tipcalc

OVERVIEW

This is version 2 of my Tip Calculator. It is a much more condensed version.
It prompts the user to enter their bill and then asks for a rating of their service.
The service is rated on a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being horrible and 5 being great.
Each rating has a preset tip percent that is then used to calculate the total.

- added ability to split the bill before calculating the total.
-- asks if you're splitting the bill, requests the number of even splits. Proceeds as normal after.

- fixed slight issue with original bill question not accepting decimals.
- rounds off at two decimal spots.
