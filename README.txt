README for tipcalc

This is version 2 of my Tip Calculator. It is a much more condensed version.
It prompts the user to enter their bill and then asks for a rating of their service.
The service is rated on a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being horrible and 5 being great.
Each rating has a preset tip percent that is then used to calculate the total.
